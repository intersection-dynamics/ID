# Intersection Dynamics: Computational Framework

Computational validation of Intersection Dynamics (ID) theory through GPU-accelerated 4D field simulations. This framework tests the core predictions of a geometric theory of matter and cosmology that explains dark matter, cosmic expansion, and structure formation through higher-dimensional field intersections.

## Theory Overview

Intersection Dynamics proposes that observable particles emerge as topologically protected intersection structures where higher-dimensional field configurations cross our three-dimensional manifold. Key predictions:

- **Dark Matter**: Bulk-dimensional mass invisible to 3D electromagnetic radiation
- **Topological Stability**: Intersection structures maintain persistent identity through topological protection
- **Cosmic Architecture**: Multiple "precipitation" events create an extended cosmic landscape
- **Energy Separation**: Observable matter represents ~2-5% of total intersection mass

## Computational Approach

### 4D Field Evolution
- Complex field Î¨(x,y,z,w) evolution using spectral split-step methods
- Dynamic 3D slices moving through higher-dimensional space
- GPU-accelerated using CuPy for high-performance computation

### Topological Analysis
- Hopf index calculations via spectral stereographic projection
- Topological charge tracking over extended evolution periods
- Multiple intersection geometries: knotted vortices, linked rings, Hopf bundles

### Key Diagnostics
- Energy conservation monitoring (4D total, 3D slice)
- Topological charge stability analysis
- Bulk vs. 3D energy ratios (dark matter analog)
- Long-term structural persistence

## Key Results

### Topological Stability Demonstration
- **Hopf bundle configurations**: Stable topological charges over 2000+ timesteps
